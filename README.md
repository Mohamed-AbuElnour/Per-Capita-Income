# Per-Capita-Income
## Introduction:
> Using **the Economy dataset in Gapminder World**, I investigate the relationship between *Per Capita Income (as the dependent variable) and three independent variables which are: Trade Balance (as % of GDP), Tax Revenues (as % of GDP), and Foreign Direct Investment Flows (as % of GDP)*

> I believe that the level of income citizens enjoy, is a result of efforts that have been made over the years. So, my analysis depends on looking at the dependent variable in a time snapshot (a selected year) and investigating the developments in the independent variables over previous decades, so that I can find common patterns for the countires with highest level of per capita income (as well as those countires with lowest level of per capita income) with regard to these independent variables.

> The data of the dependent variable (Per Capita Income) spans from the year 1800 till 2040, whereas the three independent variables range from 1960s and 1970s till 2019. Therefore, I'll use 2019 as the time snapshot used for analyzing the dependent variable, and then investigate the independent variables over their course of time, in order to figure out the sort of association between the dependent variable and the independent variables.

> **In this analysis, I'll address these questions:**
- Is there a relation between trade balance and the per capita income level?
- Is there a relation between tax revenues and the per capita income level?
- Is there a relation between FDI affect the per capita income level?

## Conclusion
- The Data Analysis process for top countries in per capita income pinpoints that those countries have some common characteristics that are different from the bottom per capita income countries. These characteristics are:

> **Higher Trade Balance:** Top countries in per capita income tend to have rising trade balances (as % of GDP) over time. This either imply that they managed to decrease trade deficits over time till incurring surpluses or they already have trade surpluses over time even at a decreasing rate. However, bottom countries in per capita income tend to have declining trade balances over time. This either imply that they continued to run trade deficits over time at a worsening rate or their efforts to curb trade deficits were not enough as they still run considerable trade deficits.

> **Higher Tax Revenues:** Top countries in per capita income tend to have more tax revenues (as % of GDP) on average, than bottom countries in per capita income.

> **Higher FDI Inflows:** Top countries in per capita income tend to be more attractive for FDI inflows (as % of GDP) on average, than bottom countries in per capita income.

- One important finding is that bottom per capita income countries are all African. The analysis shows us that that these countries have been suffering over time as seen from deteriorating trade balances, lower tax revenues, and lower FDI inflows
- On the flip side, the majority of top per capita income group are European countries where their indicators have been improving over time. This group also contains Asian countirs, albeit they're all oil rich countries.
